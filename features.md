Features:

* 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and accumulator, 8-bit registers (one 16-bit register with special move instructions), 8-bit data bus and 2×16-bit address buses, program counter, data pointer, and related 8/11/16-bit operations; hence it is mainly an 8-bit microcontroller
* Boolean processor with 17 instructions, 1-bit accumulator, 32 registers (4x8-bit, bit-addressable) and up to 144 special 1 bit-addressable RAM variables (18x8-bit)[4]
* Multiply, divide and compare instructions
* Interrupts
* 128 or 256 bytes of on-chip RAM (IRAM)
* Dual 16-bit address bus; it can access 2×216 memory locations: 64 KB (65,536 locations) each of ROM (PMEM) and external RAM (XRAM), using two memory buses in a Harvard architecture.
* On-chip ROM (not included on 803x variants)
* Four (three full) 8-bit bi-directional input/output ports, bit addressable
* UART (serial port)
